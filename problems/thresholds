# Threshold settings for dashboard metrics - UI

Talkdesk is about more than making and receiving calls. We want to provide insights to our supervisors so that they can monitor everything from call volume to agent status. We do this with our Talkesk Live dashboard where each module can be customized to the supervisors needs. This includes setting performance thresholds.

A performance threshold usually represents a target zone of performance. For example, a supervisor may set a target zone for Avg Wait Time. This is the time a caller will wait on the phone before their call is routed to an available agent. Lets say, in this case, the supervisor wants to be visually alerted any time the average wait time exceeds 10 minutes. This is a simple binary threshold. Anything below 10m is the good zone (0m - 10m), anything above (10 < âˆž) is bad. Now lets add more value for the supervisor by adding a third assume we want to give the supervisor a graduated threshold so that they can be visually alerted, not just when the threshold is met, but as avg wait time nears the threshold. Lets call this the "caution" zone.

- You can specify the days of the week that you are open
- You can set the working period that will apply to every selected day

For this challenge we want you to extend Talkdesk's functionality to meet the request of some customers that have asked for a more flexible business hour solution.

## Personas
- Administrator - owns configuration of the entire Talkdesk deployment
- Director/Supervisor - owns configuration of a particular segment of Talkdesk users
- Agent - daily user of Talkdesk
- End Customer/Caller
